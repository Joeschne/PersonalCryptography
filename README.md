# PersonalCrpytography

## Overview

I want to use this for me to understand crpytographic operations and I want it to be able to be used as a sort of password manager that doesn't really store passwords but just uses plaintext and hashes it which can be stored as a password


Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only. Though the idea is to try out cryptographics, it's like really slow right now and probably not even cryptograhically sound.
